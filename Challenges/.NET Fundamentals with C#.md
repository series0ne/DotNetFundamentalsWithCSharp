# .NET Fundamentals with C#



### Challenge 1

A palindrome is a word that is spelt the same way from right-to-left as it's spelt from left-to-right; for example, the English word "level", or the Finnish word "saippuakivikauppias". 

Write a program that determines whether a word is a palindrome. The program should be case insensitive; for example, "Level" should be considered palindromic.

**GIVEN** the user inputs a word into the console

**WHEN** the user presses the Enter/Return key

**THEN** the word "True" should be output to the console if the word is a palindrome; otherwise, "False".



### Challenge 2

You're working on an EPoS (Electronic Point of Sale) software platform, and you need to find an algorithm that calculates the fewest number of coins required in order to give a customer change for a purchase. For example, a customer is owed £1.37 - the fewest number of coins required to satisfy the request is 5.

Write a program that calculates the fewest number of coins required to satisfy a given change value.

**GIVEN** a change value

**WHEN** the value is passed into the algorithm

**THEN** the algorithm should return the fewest number of coins required to satisfy the request

- The program may work with whole (integral) numbers; for example £1.37 = 137
- You may use the denominations for legal tender in Pound Sterling: £2, £1, 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p and 1p
- The program should work with unordered denominations; for example: 20p, £2, 50p, £1, 10p, 5p, 1p, 2p
- The program should work when denominations are missing; for example: £1, 50p, 10p, 2p, 1p
- If the available denominations are unable to satisfy a given value then the program should throw an exception stating "Unable to satisfy request."



### Challenge 3

You have an array of integral values and you want to find the distinct sums of every odd number pair in the array; for example when given the array `new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };` the odd number pairs would be (1,3) (1,5) (1,7) (1,9) (3,5) (3,7) (3,9) (5,7) (5,9) (7,9) however the sums of (1,9) and (3,7) are 10, therefore only one pair needs to be stored.

**GIVEN** an array of integral values

**WHEN** the numbers are filtered and paired

**THEN** the program should result in distinct sums of each pair (but not necessarily distinct pairs)

- The program should filter out any even numbers in the array
- The program should establish every odd number pair in the filtered array
  - A number cannot be paired with itself, unless it's duplicated in the array
  - A pair does not need to exist in both permutations - e.g. (1, 9) and (9, 1) since they both sum to the same value
- The program should maintain a list of the distinct sums, not the distinct pairs
  - **RIGHT** (1,9) = 10
    **WRONG** (1,9) = 10, (3, 7) = 10
